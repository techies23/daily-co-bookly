<p>Hello {therapist_name},</p><p>This is a reminder that there are completed sessions for which the clients have not yet been invoiced.</p>
<p>Please approve the invoices in the ‘Completed Sessions’ tab of your Headroom dashboard. If relevant, input the associated ICD Code for the completed session and click on the ‘send invoice’ button. This will automatically generate and send an invoice to your client. You will also receive a copy.</p>
<p>Should you require any assistance kindly contact admin@headroom.co.za.</p><p>Regards,<br> The Headroom Team</p>
